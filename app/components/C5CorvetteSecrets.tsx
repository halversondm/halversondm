      <ul className="c5">
        <li>
          The little yellow &quot;helper light&quot; on the bottom of the
          rear-view mirror is to illuminate the shifter area
        </li>
        <li>
          You can put your key in the driver&apos;s door and turn it twice
          toward the front to unlock the passenger door and a third time to pop
          the trunk
        </li>
        <li>
          You can pop the trunk and also pop the gas cap cover by pulling on
          metal lines hidden in the back
        </li>
        <li>
          The little slotted cover on the dash behind the steering wheel is
          where the inside air temperature sensor is located
        </li>
        <li>All of the option codes are on a sticker inside the glove box</li>
        <li>
          The thing that looks like a little LED near the DIC buttons is a light
          sensor
        </li>
        <li>
          The thing that looks like a little LED near the defroster vent is a UV
          sensor for determining A/C usage to compensate for the heating effect
          of the sun
        </li>
        <li>The build sheet is in the front re-bar</li>
        <li>
          If you leave your turn signal on, in about 1 minute it will start to
          ding (loud enough to hear over the stereo) to let you know you have
          left it on
        </li>
        <li>
          You can reset the oil life by pumping the gas pedal three times with
          the engine off
        </li>
        <li>
          Hold down the reset button while on one of the trip odometers and it
          changes that reading to the mils you&apos;ve traveled since last
          starting the engine
        </li>
        <li>
          Hold down the Active Handling button for 5 seconds to engage
          &apos;Competitive Driving&apos; if so equipped
        </li>
        <li>
          If you pull the seatbelts all the way out while you&apos;re buckled
          in, they ratchet back in to hold you tighter into the seat
        </li>
        <li>
          Simply remove fuse #2 under the hood and your Daytime Running Lights
          will be out permanently. The only thing affected is that when you
          unlock at night using the key fob your front turn signal lights and
          backup lights will not flash. Your front turn signals will operate
          normally, however.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can also disable Daytime Running Lights by pulling the parking
          brake up one click without concern of operation to the parking brake
        </li>
        <li>
          The side-view mirrors can twist both forward and backward, decreasing
          the chance of damage if struck
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a release opening with a flap to let air out of the car when
          the hatch is closed. It is located just above the driver side rear
          compartment, behind the carpet and on the side of the car. Not that it
          really works well!
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have a 6-speed transmission you can pop the trunk when the car
          is running by lifting the parking brake.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can ground your amp to a screw/bolt that holds the rear middle
          compartment to the frame
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a spot in the middle storage compartment left of center for
          the factory wheel lock key
        </li>
        <li>
          If you turn on the headlights, then go to parking light position, the
          pop up lights remain up, but the lights are off
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have the passive entry feature: If you lock your keys in the
          car, wait a few minutes and then shake the car. That will unlock the
          car.
        </li>
        <li>
          The heads-up display has a shift light for manual transmission cars
        </li>
        <li>
          You can easily shift the 6 speed transmission up or down without the
          clutch if you match revs. However, not generally a good idea.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can eject the CD from the in-dash player without turning on any
          power. You don&apos;t even need the key in the ignition.
        </li>
        <li>
          The cruise will disengage if you purposely make sharp side to side
          turns while cruising at say 60-80 mph
        </li>
        <li>
          When the engine is shut off, you can get the odometer reading by
          turning on the parking lights
        </li>
        <li>
          You can program setting #3 (both memory buttons at once) in the seat
          memory to run the seat back and steering wheel forward for getting
          in/out of car with the engine running
        </li>
