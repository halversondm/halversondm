                <h4 className="text-success">My wife calls me a &apos;computer geek&apos;. I don&apos;t
                    mind. It&apos;s true.</h4>
                <p>I received my first computer when I was seven years old. It was a
                    Tandy 1000 with dual floppy drives and 128KB of
                    RAM. We eventually upgraded to 640 KB of RAM, the maximum, and a 20 MB
                    hard drive. A modem was a must. In those
                    days, you could code, play games and check out BBS, but not much else.
                    It&apos;s been said before, and it will be said
                    again the
                    internet changed everything for me. AOL was a glorified BBS. The
                    internet was, and is, open to do with what you
                    please. I turned my hobby
                    into a profession. </p>
                <h4 className="text-success">I love the mechanics of the combustion
                    engine.</h4>
                <p>I have my dad to thank for this. My father spent 45 years in the auto
                    parts business. Half of those years, when I was
                    14 years old and under,
                    as a store owner. I spent a good bit of time selling parts and
                    learning about the engine. He had a machine shop in
                    the back of the store and I spent time taking customers engines apart
                    for valve jobs. It was the coolest thing. One
                    of my favorite smells is uncatalyzed exhaust. These days I do what I
                    can on my cars. The difficult projects require
                    Dad&apos;s help and I enjoy that time we spend together.</p>
                <h4 className="text-success">Kids</h4>
                <p>I have two. Other than this paragraph, I won&apos;t push a page about them
                    in the open internet. I love them and enjoy
                    watching them grow.</p>
                <h4 className="text-success">Wife</h4>
                <p>I met my wife in 1996 at Eastern Illnois University. We were freshman
                    and had mutual friends. We&apos;ve been
                    together ever since. She&apos;s great! We compliment each other very well.
                    At least I think so. We each have our
                    strengths and weaknesses. However, I can&apos;t think of a weakness we
                    share. Well, chocolate, we both love
                    chocolate...</p>
                <h4 className="text-success">Golf</h4>
                <p>I try. I&apos;m getting better. My best friend urged me to join on a
                    regular golf trip with other mutual long time friends
                    in 2014. I bought new clubs that fit me and spent countless hours
                    thinking about hitting that little white
                    ball. Lots of range time too. More range time than course time,
                    actually. I have yet to break 100 or get a birdie,
                    but 2016 is my year.</p>
                <h4 className="text-success">Skiing</h4>
                <p>Like my friends that have been golfing forever, I&apos;ve been skiing
                    since I was 6. I love it. I&apos;m aggressive. I ski
                    backwards downhill. It&apos;s Double Blacks for me. There is something
                    about the speed, cold, and changes in terrain that
                    just light you up.</p>
                <h4 className="text-success">Yard Work</h4>
                <p>I hate it.</p>
